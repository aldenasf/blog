# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first post written in MDX. With MDX, you can use JSX elements directly inside your Markdown content.

Here is a regular Markdown paragraph. And here is some inline JSX:

<div style={{ padding: "10px", backgroundColor: "#f0f0f0" }}>This is a custom-styled div using inline JSX.</div>

## Another Section

You can also use regular Markdown syntax, like lists:

-   Item 1
-   Item 2
-   Item 3

And here is some inline code: `const x = 10;`

### Embedding JSX

You can embed JSX elements directly within your MDX content. For example, let's create a simple alert box using inline JSX.

<div style={{ border: "1px solid red", padding: "10px", backgroundColor: "#ffe6e6" }}>
    This is an important message inside an alert box.
</div>

## Conclusion

MDX allows you to write JSX within your Markdown content, giving you the power to enhance your documentation or blog posts without needing to import external components.

Thanks for reading!
